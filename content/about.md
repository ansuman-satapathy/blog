## Hi, I'm Ansuman.

I'm a backend developer who accidentally started enjoying the Ops side of things a little too much.

I work at a small company, which means I don't just write the code. I have to make sure it actually runs somewhere other than my laptop. I write the application logic, but I also build the pipelines that ship it to the server. I’ve always been a Linux tinkerer (Broken my fair share of them), so taking over the CI/CD workflows felt weirdly natural.

I’m not trying to force a specific title. I just hate black boxes. If I write the code, I want to understand exactly how it runs on the server and how to fix it when it inevitably crashes.

I created this site to document that journey. Mostly so I can look back later and remember how I fixed that one specific Kubernetes error, but also to help anyone else who might be stuck in the same boat. You will also find my projects here, along with the documentation covering how (and why) I built them.
