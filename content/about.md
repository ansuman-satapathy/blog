## I'm Ansuman

I am a backend developer who also handles the Ops side of things.

Working at a small company means I own the code from the editor to the server. I write the application logic, but I also build and manage the deployment pipelines to keep it running.

I’ve always been a Linux tinkerer (I've broken my fair share of installations), so taking over the CI/CD workflows felt natural. Now, I'm diving deeper into **Go**, **Kubernetes**, and **Cloud** architecture.
