## I'm Ansuman!

I am a backend developer who also manages and enjoys the Ops side of things. Working at a small company means I own the code from the editor to the server. I write the application logic, but I also build and manage the deployment pipelines to keep it running.

I’ve always been a Linux tinkerer (I've broken my fair share of them), so taking over the CI/CD workflows felt natural. I probably enjoyed it a bit more than I'd like to admit.

I don't want to be "just a dev" or "just an ops guy." So, here I am trying to find my place in the intersection of these roles. I am no Linus, but I would like to share my journey and the things I learn along the way. Mostly for myself when I am lost, and also to help others that might be in the same boat.

Right now, I’m spending my time building with **Go** and figuring out the moving parts of **Kubernetes**, while keeping my **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** workflows as clean as possible.
